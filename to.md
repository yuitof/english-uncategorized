- As a result, the callback tries to reference bar even though it may not have that variable in scope yet, because the script has not been able to run to completion.

- You have two options for a destination Worker Pool to which to offload work.

- If you read shorter files for some users and longer files for others, fs.readFile() may introduce significant variation in Task lengths, to the detriment of Worker Pool throughput.

- To these ends Node.js has introduced N-API in version 8.6.0 and marked it as a stable component of the project as of Node.js 8.12.0. The API is defined in the headers node_api.h and node_api_types.h, and provides a forward- compatibility guarantee that crosses the Node.js major version boundary. The guarantee can be stated as follows:

- Additionally, from outside the custom stream, there are pitfalls to ignoring backpressure.

- Parameter annotations are defined by a colon after the parameter name, followed by an expression evaluating to the value of the annotation.

- To that end, the threading module provides a number of synchronization primitives including locks, events, condition variables, and semaphores.
